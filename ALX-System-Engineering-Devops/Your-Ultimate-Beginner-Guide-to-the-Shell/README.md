    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>In this guide, you will learn about the basics of the shell and how to use it effectively. The shell is a command-line interface that allows you to interact with your computer's operating system. This guide is designed for beginners, but even experienced users may find some helpful tips and tricks.</p>
    <h2 id="what-is-the-shell">What is the shell?</h2>
    <p>The shell is a command-line interface that allows you to interact with your computer's operating system. It provides a way to run commands, scripts, and programs. The shell takes input from the user and passes it to the operating system to execute.</p>
    <h2 id="why-use-the-shell">Why use the shell?</h2>
    <p>The shell is a powerful tool that allows you to automate tasks, manage files, and access powerful features of your operating system. It is also faster and more efficient than using a graphical user interface (GUI) for many tasks. In addition, the shell provides a wealth of information and resources, including man pages and online forums, that you can use to troubleshoot problems and improve your skills. By learning to use the shell, you can become a more proficient and efficient user of your computer.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-commands" id="working-with-commands">Working With Commands</h2>
<p>The shell operates by running commands. These commands can be simple, like listing the contents of a directory, or complex, like running a program. To run a command, you simply type the command at the prompt and press enter.</p>
<h3>Examples:</h3>
<pre>
<code>$ ls</code>
<code>$ pwd</code>
</pre>
<p>In the examples above, the "ls" command lists the contents of the current directory, and the "pwd" command displays the full path of the current directory.</p>
<h2 id="reading-man-pages">Reading Man Pages</h2>
<p>Man pages are manual pages that provide detailed information about commands, programs, and functions in the shell. To view a man page, simply type "man" followed by the command you want information on, and press enter.</p>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
<code>$ man ls</code>
</pre>
<p>In the example above, the "man" command is used to view the man page for the "ls" command.</p>
<h2 id="keyboard-shortcuts-for-bash">Keyboard Shortcuts for Bash</h2>
<p>The shell provides several keyboard shortcuts that can make using the shell faster and more efficient. Some of the most commonly used keyboard shortcuts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ctrl + A: Move to the beginning of the line</li>
<li>Ctrl + E: Move to the end of the line</li>
<li>Ctrl + U: Clear the line before the cursor</li>
<li>Ctrl + K: Clear the line after the cursor</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lts">LTS</h2>
<p>LTS stands for Long-Term Support. It refers to a version of a program or operating system that is supported for a longer period of time than a regular release. LTS releases are recommended for users who need a stable and reliable version of the software.</p>
<h2 id="shebang">Shebang</h2>
<p>The shebang is a special code in the beginning of executable files that tells the shell which interpreter to use to run the file. It is represented by the characters "#!" followed by the path to the interpreter.</p>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
<code>#!/bin/bash</code>
</pre>
<p>In the example above, the shebang tells the shell to use the "/bin/bash" interpreter to run the file.</p>
<h2 id="cd">cd</h2>
<p>The "cd" command is used to change the current directory. To change to a different directory, simply type "cd" followed by the path to the directory you want to change to, and press enter.</p>
<h3>Examples:</h3>
<pre>
<code>$ cd /home/user/documents</code>
<code>$ cd ..</code>
</pre>
<p>In the first example, the "cd" command is used to change to the "/home/user/documents" directory. In the second example, the "cd .." command is used to change to the parent directory of the current directory.</p>
<h2 id="ls">ls</h2>
<p>The "ls" command is used to list the contents of a directory. By default, "ls" will list the files and directories in the current directory. You can specify a different directory by providing its path as an argument to the "ls" command.</p>
<h3>Examples:</h3>
<pre>
<code>$ ls</code>
<code>$ ls /home/user/documents</code>
</pre>
<p>In the first example, the "ls" command is used to list the contents of the current directory. In the second example, the "ls" command is used to list the contents of the "/home/user/documents" directory.</p>
<h2 id="pwd">pwd</h2>
<p>The "pwd" command is used to display the full path of the current directory. When you run the "pwd" command, the shell will display the complete path to the current directory, including all parent directories.</p>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
<code>$ pwd</code>
</pre>
<p>In the example above, the "pwd" command is used to display the full path of the current directory.</p>
<h2 id="less">less</h2>
<p>The "less" command is used to view the contents of a file. Unlike the "cat" command, which displays the entire contents of a file, the "less" command displays the contents of a file one screen at a time. This makes it useful for viewing large files.</p>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
<code>$ less file.txt</code>
</pre>
<p>In the example above, the "less" command is used to view the contents of the "file.txt" file.</p>
<h2 id="file">file</h2>
<p>The "file" command is used to determine the type of a file. It is useful for determining whether a file is a text file, an image, a program, etc.</p>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
<code>$ file file.txt</code>
</pre>
<p>In the example above, the "file" command is used to determine the type of the "file.txt" file.</p>
<h2 id="ln">ln</h2>
<p>The "ln" command is used to create links between files. There are two types of links: hard links and symbolic (or soft) links. A hard link creates a new directory entry that points to an existing file, while a symbolic link creates a new file that contains a reference to another file. When you access a symbolic link, it acts as a pointer to the original file.</p>
<h3>Examples:</h3>
<pre>
<code>$ ln file.txt file_link.txt</code>
<code>$ ln -s file.txt file_symbolic_link.txt</code>
</pre>
<p>In the first example, a hard link "file_link.txt" is created to the "file.txt" file. In the second example, a symbolic link "file_symbolic_link.txt" is created to the "file.txt" file.</p>
<h2 id="cp">cp</h2>
<p>The "cp" command is used to copy files and directories. When you use the "cp" command, a new file is created with the same contents as the original file.</p>
<h3>Examples:</h3>
<pre>
<code>$ cp file.txt file_copy.txt</code>
<code>$ cp -r directory directory_copy</code>
</pre>
<p>In the first example, a copy of the "file.txt" file is created as "file_copy.txt". In the second example, a copy of the "directory" is created as "directory_copy". The "-r" option is used to copy the directory and its contents recursively.</p>
<h2 id="mv">mv</h2>
<p>The "mv" command is used to move or rename files and directories. When you use the "mv" command to move a file, it is physically moved to a different location. When you use the "mv" command to rename a file, its name is changed without moving it to a different location.</p>
<h3>Examples:</h3>
<pre>
<code>$ mv file.txt /home/user/documents/file.txt</code>
<code>$ mv file.txt file_renamed.txt</code>
</pre>
<p>In the first example, the "file.txt" file is moved to the "/home/user/documents" directory. In the second example, the "file.txt" file is renamed to "file_renamed.txt".</p>
<h2 id="rm">rm</h2>
<p>The "rm" command is used to delete files and directories. When you use the "rm" command, the file or directory is permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.</p>
<h3>Examples:</h3>
<pre>
<code>$ rm file.txt</code>
<code>$ rm -r directory</code>
</pre>
<p>In the first example, the "file.txt" file is deleted. In the second example, the "directory" and its contents are deleted recursively with the "-r" option.</p>
<h2 id="mkdir">mkdir</h2>
<p>The "mkdir" command is used to create a new directory. When you use the "mkdir" command, a new, empty directory is created with the specified name.</p>
<h3>Example: </h3>
    <pre>
      <code>$ mkdir new_directory</code>
    </pre>
    <p>In this example, a new directory named "new_directory" is created.</p>
    <h2 id="type">type</h2>
    <p>The "type" command is used to determine the type of a command. This is useful when you want to determine if a command is an internal shell command or an external executable file.</p>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <pre>
      <code>$ type ls</code>
    </pre>
    <p>In this example, the type of the "ls" command is displayed. The output might show that "ls" is an internal shell command or an executable file located in a directory specified in the PATH environment variable.</p>
    <h2 id="which">which</h2>
    <p>The "which" command is used to locate a command. This is useful when you want to determine the location of an executable file associated with a command.</p>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <pre>
      <code>$ which ls</code>
    </pre>
    <p>In this example, the location of the "ls" command is displayed. The output might show the full path to the executable file for the "ls" command.</p>
    <h2 id="help">help</h2>
    <p>The "help" command is used to display information about shell commands. This is useful when you want to learn more about a specific command and its options.</p>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <pre>
      <code>$ help ls</code>
    </pre>
    <p>In this example, information about the "ls" command is displayed, including its options and usage.</p>
    <h2 id="man">man</h2>
    <p>The "man" command is used to display the manual page for a command. This is a detailed reference for a command, including its options, usage, and examples.</p>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <pre>
      <code>$ man ls</code>
    </pre>
    <p>In this example, the manual page for the "ls" command is displayed.</p>
